# Pong Game

This is a repository for a Pong game created by jkk-python-projects. The game is implemented in Python and provides a simple and interactive Pong game.

## Installation

To run the Pong game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using the following command:
   git clone https://github.com/jkk-python-projects/pong.git

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   cd pong

3. Install the required dependencies. This game doesn't have any external dependencies, so you're good to go!

## Usage

To start the Pong game, run the following command:
python main.py
angelscript

The game window will open, and you can use the arrow keys or 'W' and 'S' keys to control the paddles. The objective is to bounce the ball off the paddles and prevent it from reaching the edges of the screen.

The game will keep track of the score, and the first player to reach a certain number of points (default is 5) wins the game.

You can restart the game by pressing the spacebar after a game is over.

## File Structure

The repository has the following files:

- `ball.py`: Contains the implementation of the Ball class, which represents the game ball and handles its movement and collisions.
- `paddle.py`: Contains the implementation of the Paddle class, which represents the player-controlled paddles and handles their movement.
- `scoreboard.py`: Contains the implementation of the Scoreboard class, which keeps track of the score and displays it on the screen.
- `main.py`: The main entry point of the game. It sets up the game window, handles user input, and updates the game state.
